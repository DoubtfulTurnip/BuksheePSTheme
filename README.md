## General info
I have shamelessly stolen ideas from the web to customise my PowerShell and WSL2 experience and then put it all in a script that makes it easier to re-install across multiple systems.
At this stage the script is still in very early development but hopefully somebody might find it handy.


## Setup
To run this project, clone the repo and run the ThemeInstall.ps1 file from within the folder.


## Prerequisites
This script presumes you are running Windows 10 with Windows Terminal and WSL2 installed.
Please check the code before running as this will modify your Windows Terminal Profile.
This script has been written for my personal Windows 10 environments, it may not function the same for yours if you choose to use it but I would be interested in hearing if there are any issues with it.


## Future
Lots more customisation options
