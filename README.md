## General info
My personal PowerShell theme installer.
In addition to modifying the theme for PowerShell, the script also installs neofetch to WSL2 and adds it to the .profile file


## Setup
To run this project, clone the repo and run the ThemeInstall.ps1 file


## Work In Progress
At the moment the installer is configured for WSL2 Ubuntu-20.04 & Kali-Linux installations and will error without these
The next step is to add all configuration variations of WSL2 based on what is currently installed
